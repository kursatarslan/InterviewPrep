Thank you for the opportunity to discuss my application for the Engineering Lead position. 
I am excited about the prospect of contributing to Deloitte's esteemed UK Digital Services team, 
especially given the team's commitment to creating consumer-grade digital experiences.

With over a decade of leadership experience in the software development industry, 
I bring a wealth of knowledge in .NET and Python, specifically in building scalable web and native applications on cloud platforms.
My technical journey has been marked by a deep involvement in the intricacies of cryptocurrency platforms and trading engine architecture, 
which aligns well with Deloitte's innovative and future-forward ethos.

At my current position with Himalaya Exchange,
I have led a team towards transforming our front-end work into a React-based micro-frontend architecture, 
all while managing a robust CI/CD pipeline that utilizes AWS EKS and ArgoCD for deployment. 
This experience has honed my skills in fostering a culture of accountability and self-organization, 
which I understand is pivotal to the role at Deloitte.

I am particularly drawn to Deloitte's values of leadership, integrity, care, inclusion, and collaboration. I believe my proactive approach in recommending and implementing enhancements to delivery processes, coupled with my technical and product development thought leadership, positions me to effectively contribute to your team.

Moreover, my hands-on experience with Azure PaaS services, Azure SQL DB, and DevOps practices, augmented by a strong foundation in programming languages like .NET Core, C#, T-SQL, and JavaScript, equips me to take on the technical challenges inherent in this role. I am adept at architectural design, identifying emerging risks, and providing technical guidance to scrum teamsâ€”skills that I am eager to bring to the Digital Services team.

In addition to my technical acumen, I am a strong communicator and decision-maker, and I invest time in developing individuals within my team. I believe in leading by example and am keen on taking mentorship roles to nurture the next generation of developers.

I am excited about the possibility of bringing my blend of experience, leadership, and passion for technology to Deloitte, and I look forward to contributing to a firm where innovation, growth, and excellence are at the forefront.




In my current role as Head of Development at Hamilton Capital Holding, I oversee the strategic planning and execution of our software architecture, 
leading the development efforts from concept through to deployment. My role is multifaceted, combining the oversight of our team's efforts with active, hands-on coding and system design.

I spearheaded the design of our system's architecture, laying a strong foundation with .NET Core and a React-based frontend. 
My approach was to create a robust, scalable solution tailored to the financial services sector's complex and dynamic requirements. 
With a focus on microservices, I developed a template for our .NET WebAPI that would streamline our development process and ensure consistency across services.

A key part of our system is the API Gateway, which I developed to manage a multitude of microservices, ensuring secure, efficient operations. 
It acts as a crucial entry point in our system, routing requests to the appropriate services and providing an additional layer of security.

To handle communication between our microservices, 
I implemented an EventBus system utilizing MassTransit. This allows for a seamless, event-driven approach that enhances the scalability and resilience of our applications. 
It's particularly beneficial in a financial context where real-time data and transactions are paramount.

Throughout all of this, my role has been hands-on. Not only have I been involved in the decision-making and architectural design, 
but I've also been directly coding these components and working alongside my team to integrate them into our broader system. 
This practical involvement has allowed me to maintain a deep understanding of our technology stack 
and the needs of our development team, ensuring that our solutions are not only theoretically sound but also pragmatically effective.

In essence, my role as Head of Development is to ensure that our technology strategy aligns with business objectives, 
leading by example and providing technical expertise to deliver applications that drive the company forward.
